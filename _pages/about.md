“Nyonura” is a nickname that was given to my late mom (Julia Ondeng - RIP) by my grandfather when she was a child.

I build things using software and yes 'software will eat the world' --Marc Andressen. Currently a lot of the work I am doing is in Ruby on Rails.
I am interested in financial systems technology and how tech like ML can push the boundaries in this space.

During the day I am the CTO at [Kopo Kopo, Inc.](http://www.kopokopo.com) building awesome software that helps small and medium sized business
digitze their transactions and build business tools that allow their businesses to grow and prosper.

I'm also an amateur photographer 'wannabe' and you can find some of my best photographs [here](https://500px.com/donden1). Drop me some tips if you fancy!
