“Nyonura” is a nickname that was given to my late mom (Julia Ondeng) by my grandfather when she was a child. 
‘Onura’ is actually the name of my great – great – grandmother and hence ‘Nyonura’. I lost my mom to cancer in 
March 2011 and I was looking for a simple way to try and honour her memory.

I'm a die hard Ruby on Rails convert primarily interested in mobile technology, mobile payments, machine learning and Bitcoin among other tech topics.

During the day I am a software engineer at [Kopo Kopo, Inc.](http://www.kopokopo.com) building awesome software that helps small and medium sized business
digitze their transactions and build cool applications from this data to help them grow and prosper.

I'm also an amateur photographer 'wannabe' and you can find some of [my best photographs here](https://500px.com/donden1). Drop me some tips if you fancy!
