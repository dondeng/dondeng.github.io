Here are some of the projects (public) that I have worked on or is working on. 

### GCM on Rails

Gcm on Rails (gcm_on_rails) is a Ruby on Rails gem that allows you to easily incorporate Google’s ‘Google Cloud Messaging for Android’ 
into your Rails application. The project can be found on [Github](https://github.com/dondeng/gcm_on_rails)
