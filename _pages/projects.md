# Projects
------------------

Here are some of the projects (public) that I have worked on or I'm currently working on. 

### GCM on Rails

Gcm on Rails (gcm_on_rails) is a Ruby on Rails gem that allows you to easily incorporate Google’s ‘Google Cloud Messaging for Android’ 
into your Rails application. The project can be found on [Github](https://github.com/dondeng/gcm_on_rails)

### Four Eyes

four_eyes is a Ruby on Rails gem to implement maker-checker functionality on CRUD actions within controllers. Due to security concerns, some
institutions such as banks, mobile operators etc increasingly insist on the principle of "four eyes" for actions taken within their financial
systems. The "four eyes principle" is a requirement that two individuals review and approve some action before it can be taken. four_eyes
is open source and can be found on Github.
