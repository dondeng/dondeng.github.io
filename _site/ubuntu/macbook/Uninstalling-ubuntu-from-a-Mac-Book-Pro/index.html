<p>I am not an apple fan-boy, but I admit that I like apple hardware – specifically the Mac Book Pro. For this reason, I usually run 
Ubuntu on my Mac Book Pro. If it was not for iTunes, I probably would not even dual-boot. I can never get over the awesomeness of 
‘sudo apt-get install xxxxx’ in comparison to the apple ‘walled garden’. Recently, I wanted to sell one of the Mac Book Pro’s I had 
so that  I could up-grade to a later model. (Apparently Mac Book Pro’s never grow old!). The person I was selling the laptop to did not 
want Ubuntu in it so I had the odious task of un-installing Ubuntu (12.04). Therein lies the problem. There is a lot of literature on 
the web about how to install Ubuntu on Mac Books since the advent of Mac Books using Intel chips, but there are not a lot of folks 
talking about how to remove Ubuntu. After Googling around, here are the steps that worked for me:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get an Ubuntu – Live CD. You will need it to delete the Linux partitions</li>
  <li>Boot into the Ubuntu Live CD (press the C button while restarting with the Ubuntu CD/DVD in the drive)</li>
  <li>Start Gparted the Ubuntu partitioning program. If unsure on how to do this, just go the the ‘Dash Home’ and search for Gparted</li>
  <li>Delete the Linux partition</li>
  <li>Set the swap partition to “off”. In my case, I tried deleting the swap partition and it would not let me do so until I turned it ‘off’</li>
  <li>Now delete the swap partition</li>
  <li>Gparted operations are complete at this time</li>
  <li>Important note! Do NOT re-size the Mac-OS partition while in Gparted this will be done from Mac-OS</li>
  <li>Reboot the laptop and boot into Mac OS X</li>
  <li>Start the Disk Utility application and go to ‘Partition’</li>
  <li>Re-size the Mac OS partition by dragging it to the bottom to take up the space that had been taken up by Ubuntu</li>
  <li>Re-boot and make sure those changes have taken effect</li>
  <li>Next we need to delete rEffit (I was using rEffit – but  I understand it is now legacy)</li>
  <li>Instructions for uninstalling rEffit are located at their site here
In my case method 1 was the one applicable
Delete the efi folder
Delete rEffitBlesser folder in “Library/StartupItems”</li>
  <li>Reboot and that’s it!!</li>
</ol>
